<p>
    Richmond has comparatively but few antiquarian or poetical visiters,
    notwithstanding all its associations with the ancient splendour of the
    English court, and the hallowed names of Pope and Thomson. Maurice sings,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  To thy sequester'd bow'rs and wooded height,</p>
<p>  That ever yield my soul renew'd delight,</p>
<p>  Richmond, I fly! with all thy beauties fir'd,</p>
<p>  By raptur'd poets sung, by kings admir'd!</p>
</div></div>
<p>
    but ninety-nine out of a hundred who visit Richmond, thank the gods they
    are not poetical, fly off to the <i>Star and Garter</i> hill, and content
    themselves with the inspirations of its well-stored cellars. All this
    corresponds with the turtle-feasting celebrity of the modern <i>Sheen</i>; but
    it ill accords with the antiquarian importance and resplendent scenery of
    this delightful country.
</p>
<p>
    Our engraving is from a very old drawing, representing the palace at
    Richmond, as built by Henry VII. The manor-house at Sheen, a little east
    of the bridge, and close by the river side, became a <i>royal palace</i> in
    the time of Edward I., for he and his successor resided here. Edward III.
    died here in 1377. Queen Anne, the consort of his successor, died here in
    1394. Deeply affected at her death, he, according to Holinshed, "caused
    it to be thrown down and defaced; whereas the former kings of this land,
    being wearie of the citie, used customarily thither to resort as to a
    place of pleasure, and serving highly to their recreation." Henry V.,
    however, restored the palace to its former magnificence; and Henry VII.
    held, in 1492, a grand tournament here. In 1499, it was almost consumed
    by fire, when Henry rebuilt the palace, and gave it the name of RICHMOND.
</p>
<p>
    Cardinal Wolsey frequently resided here; and Hall, in his Chronicles,
    says, that "when the common people, and especially such as had been
    servants of Henry VII., saw the cardinal keep house in the manor royal at
    Richmond, which that monarch so highly esteemed, it was a marvel to hear
    how they grudged, saying, 'so a butcher's dogge doth lie in the manor of
    Richmond!'"<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>[pg 242]</span>
    Queen Elizabeth was prisoner at Richmond during the reign of her sister
    Mary; after she came to the throne, the palace was her favourite
    residence; and here she died in 1608. Charles I. formed a large
    collection of pictures here; and Charles II. was educated at Richmond. On
    the restoration, the palace was in a very dismantled state, and having,
    during the commonwealth, been plundered and defaced, it never recovered
    its pristine splendour.
</p>
<p>
    The survey taken by order of parliament in 1649, affords a minute
    description of the palace. The great hall was one hundred feet in length,
    and forty in breadth, having a screen at the lower end, over which was
    "fayr foot space in the higher end thereof, the pavement of square tile,
    well lighted and seated; at the north end having a turret, or clock-case,
    covered with lead, which is a special ornament to this building." The
    prince's lodgings are described as a "freestone building, three stories
    high, with <i>fourteen turrets</i> covered with lead," being "a very graceful
    ornament to the whole house, and perspicuous to the county round about."
    A round tower is mentioned, called the "Canted Tower," with a staircase
    of one hundred and twenty-four steps. The chapel was ninety-six feet long
    and forty broad, with cathedral-seats and pews. Adjoining the prince's
    garden was an open gallery, two hundred feet long, over which was a close
    gallery of similar length. Here was also a royal library. Three pipes
    supplied the palace with water, one from the white conduit in the new
    park, another from the conduit in the town fields, and the third from a
    conduit near the alms-houses in Richmond. In 1650, it was sold for
    10,000<i>l</i>. to private persons.
</p>
<p>
    All the accounts which have come down to us describe the furniture and
    decorations of the ANCIENT PALACE as very superb, exhibiting in gorgeous
    tapestry the deeds of kings and of heroes who had signalized themselves
    by their conquests throughout France in behalf of their country.
</p>
<p>
    The site of Richmond Palace is now occupied by noble mansions; but AN OLD
    ARCHWAY, seen from <i>the Green</i>, still remains as a melancholy memorial of
    its regal splendour.

<h3>
    EPITOME OF COMETS.
</h3>
<p>
    (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "Hast thou ne'er seen the Comet's flaming flight?"</p>
</div></div>
<h4>
    YOUNG.
</h4>
<p>
    Comets, according to Sir Isaac Newton, are compact, solid, fixed, and
    durable bodies: in one word, a kind of planets, which move in very
    oblique orbits, every way, with the greatest freedom, persevering in
    their motions even against the course and direction of the planets; and
    their tail is a very thin, slender vapour, emitted by the head, or
    nucleus of the comet, ignited or heated by the sun.
</p>
<p>
    There are <i>bearded</i>, <i>tailed</i>, and <i>hairy</i> comets; thus, when the comet is
    eastward of the sun, and moves from it, it is said to be <i>bearded</i>,
    because the light precedes it in the manner of a beard. When the comet is
    westward of the sun, and sets after it, it is said to be <i>tailed</i>,
    because the train follows it in the manner of a tail. Lastly, when the
    comet and the sun are diametrically opposite (the earth being between
    them) the train is hid behind the body of the comet, excepting a little
    that appears around it in the form of a border of hair, or <i>coma</i>, it is
    called <i>hairy</i>, and whence the name of comet is derived.
</p>
<p>
    For the conservation of the water and moisture of the planets, comets
    (says Sir Isaac Newton) seem absolutely requisite; from whose condensed
    vapours and exhalations all that moisture which is spent on vegetations
    and putrefactions, and turned into dry earth, may be resupplied and
    recruited; for all vegetables increase wholly from fluids, and turn by
    putrefaction into earth. Hence the quantity of dry earth must continually
    increase, and the moisture of the globe decrease, and at last be quite
    evaporated, if it have not a continual supply. And I suspect (adds Sir
    Isaac) that the spirit which makes the finest, subtilest, and best part
    of our air, and which is absolutely requisite for the life and being of
    all things, comes principally from the comets.
</p>
<p>
    Another use which he conjectures comets may be designed to serve, is that
    of recruiting the sun with fresh fuel, and repairing the consumption of
    his light by the streams continually sent forth in every direction from
    that luminary&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "From his huge vapouring train perhaps to shake</p>
<p>  Reviving moisture on the numerous orbs,</p>
<p>  Thro' which his long ellipsis winds; perhaps</p>
<p>  To lend new fuel to declining suns,</p>
<p>  To light up worlds, and feed th' ethereal fire."</p>
</div></div>
<h4>
    THOMSON.
</h4>
<p>
    Newton has computed that the sun's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>[pg 243]</span>
 heat in the comet of 1680,<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
was, to
    his heat with us at Midsummer, as twenty-eight thousand to one; and that
    the heat of the body of the comet was near two thousand times as great as
    that of red-hot iron. The same great author also calculates, that a globe
    of red-hot iron, of the dimensions of our earth, would scarce be cool in
    fifty thousand years. If then the comet be supposed to cool a hundred
    times as fast as red-hot iron, yet, since its heat was two thousand times
    greater, supposing it of the bigness of the earth, it would not be cool
    in a million of years.
</p>
<p>
    An elegant writer in the Guardian, says, "I cannot forbear reflecting on
    the insignificance of human art, when set in comparison with the designs
    of Providence. In pursuit of this thought, I considered a comet, or in
    the language of the vulgar, a blazing star, as a sky-rocket discharged by
    a hand that is Almighty. Many of my readers saw that in the year 1680,
    and if they were not mathematicians, will be amazed to hear, that it
    travelled with a much greater degree of swiftness than a cannon ball, and
    drew after it a tail of fire that was fourscore millions of miles in
    length. What an amazing thought is it to consider this stupendous body
    traversing the immensity of the creation with such a rapidity; and at the
    same time wheeling about in that line which the Almighty had prescribed
    for it! That it should move in such inconceivable fury and combustion,
    and at the same time with such an exact regularity! How spacious must the
    universe be, that gives such bodies as these their full play, without
    suffering the least disorder or confusion by it. What a glorious show are
    those beings entertained with, that can look into this great theatre of
    nature, and see myriads of such tremendous objects wandering through
    those immeasurable depths of ether, and running their appointed courses!
    Our eyes may hereafter be strong enough to command the magnificent
    prospect, and our understandings able to find out the several uses of
    these great parts of the universe. In the meantime, they are very proper
    objects for our imagination to contemplate, that we may form more
    extensive notions of infinite wisdom and power, and learn to think humbly
    of ourselves, and of all the little works of human invention." Seneca saw
    three comets, and says, "I am not of the common opinion, nor do I take a
    comet to be a sudden fire; but esteem it among the eternal works of
    nature."

<h3>
    EMBLEM OF WALES.
</h3>
<p>
    (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
</p>
<p>
    It is supposed by some of the Welsh, and in some notes to a poem the
    author (Mr. P. Lewellyn) says he has been confidently assured, that the
    leek, as is generally supposed to be, is not the original emblem of Wales,
    but the sive, or chive, which is common to almost every peasant's garden.
    It partakes of the smell and taste of the onion and leek, but is not so
    noxious, and is much handsomer than the latter. It grows in a wild state
    on the banks of the Wye, infinitely larger than when planted in gardens.
    According to the above-mentioned author, the manner in which it became
    the national emblem of Cambria was as follows:&mdash;As a prince of Wales was
    returning victorious from battle, he wished to have some leaf or flower
    to commemorate the event; but it being winter, no plant or shrub was seen
    until they came to the Wye, when they beheld the sive, which the prince
    commanded to be worn as a memorial of the victory.

<h3>
    HISTORY OF FAIRS.
</h3>
<p>
    (<i>For the Mirror.</i>)
</p>
<p>
    Fairs, among the old Romans, were holidays, on which there was an
    intermission of labour and pleadings. Among the Christians, upon any
    extraordinary solemnity, particularly the anniversary dedication of a
    church, tradesmen were wont to bring and sell their wares even in the
    churchyards, which continued especially upon the festivals of the
    dedication. This custom was kept up till the reign of Henry VI. Thus we
    find a great many fairs kept at these festivals of dedications, as at
    Westminster on St. Peter's day, at London on St. Bartholomew's, Durham on
    St. Cuthbert's day. But the great numbers of people being often the
    occasion of riots and disturbances, the privilege of holding a fair was
    granted by royal charter. At first they were only allowed in towns and
    places of strength, or where there was some bishop or governor of
    condition to keep them in order. In process of time there were several
    circumstances of favour added, people having the protection of a holiday,
    and being allowed freedom from arrests, upon the score of any difference
    not arising upon the spot. They had likewise a jurisdiction allowed them
    to do justice to those that came thither; and therefore the most
    inconsiderable fair with us has, or had, a court belonging to it, which
    takes cognizance of all manner of causes and disorders growing and
    committed upon the place, called <i>pye powder</i>, or <i>pedes pulverizati</i>.
    Some fairs are free, others charged with tolls and impositions. At free
    fairs, traders, whether natives or foreigners, are allowed to enter the
    kingdom, and are under the royal protection in coming and returning.
    They and their agents, with their goods, also their persons and goods,
    are exempt from all duties and impositions, tolls and servitudes; and
    such merchants going to or coming from the fair cannot be arrested, or
    their goods stopped. The prince only has the power to establish fairs of
    any kind. These fairs make a considerable article in the commerce of
    Europe, especially those of the Mediterranean, or inland parts, as
    Germany. The most famous are those of Frankfort and Leipsic; the fairs
    of Novi, in the Milanese; that of Riga, Arch-angel of St. Germain, at
    Paris; of Lyons; of Guibray, in Normandy; and of Beauclaire, in
    Languedoc: those of Porto-Bello, Vera Cruz, and the Havannah, are the
    most considerable in America.

    THE VIRGINAL.
</h3>
<p>
    (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
</p>
<p>
    A rare and beautiful relic of the olden time was lately presented to the
    museum of the Northern Institution, by William Mackintosh, Esq. of
    Milbank&mdash;an ancient virginal, which was in use among our ancestors prior
    to the invention of the spinnet and harpsichord. Mary, Queen of Scots,
    who delighted in music, in her moments of "joyeusitie" as John Knox
    phrases it, used to play finely on the virginal; and her more fortunate
    rival, Queen Elizabeth, was so exquisite a performer on the same
    instrument, that Melville says, on hearing her once play in her chamber,
    he was irresistibly drawn into the room. The virginal now deposited in
    the museum formerly belonged to a noble family in Inverness, and is
    considered to be the only one remaining in Scotland. It is made of oak,
    inlaid with cedar, and richly ornamented with gold. The cover and sides
    are beautifully painted with figures of birds, flowers, and leaves, the
    colours of which are still comparatively fresh and undecayed. On one part
    of the lid is a grand procession of warriors, whom a bevy of fair dames
    are propitiating by presents or offerings of wine and fruits. Altogether,
    the virginal may be regarded as a fine specimen of art, and is doubly
    interesting as a memorial of times long gone by.

    HERSCHEL'S TELESCOPE.
</h3>
<p>
    (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
</p>
<p>
    Your correspondent, a <i>Constant Reader</i>, in No. 330 of the MIRROR, is
    informed that the identical telescope which he mentions is now in the
    possession of Mr. J. Davies, optician, 101, High-street, Mary-le-bone,
    where it may be seen in a finished and perfect state. It is reckoned the
    best and most complete of its size in Europe.
</p>
<p>
    It was ordered to be made for his late majesty George III. as a challenge
    against the late Dr. Herschel's; but was prevented from being completed
    till some time after. The metals, 9-1/4 inches in diameter, having a
    diagonal eye-piece, four eye tubes of different magnifying powers, and
    three small specula of various radii, were made by Mr. Watson.

<p>
    (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
</p>
<p>
    The <i>Augustalia</i> was a festival at Rome, in commemoration of the day on
    which Augustus returned to Rome, after he had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span>
 established peace over the
    different parts of the empire. It was first established in the year of
    Rome 735.
</p>
<p>
    The <i>Fontinalia</i>, or <i>Fontanalia</i>, was a religious feast, held among the
    Romans in honour of the deities who presided over fountains or springs.
    Varro observes, that it was the custom to visit the wells on those days,
    and to cast crowns into fountains. This festival was observed on the 13th
    of October.
</p>
<p>
    The <i>Armilustrum</i> was a feast held on the 19th of October, wherein they
    sacrificed, armed at all points, and with the sound of trumpets. The
    sacrifice was intended for the expiation of the armies, and the
    prosperity of the arms of the people of Rome. This feast may be
    considered as a kind of benediction of arms. It was first observed among
    the Athenians.

<center>
    LORD BYRON AT MISSOLONGHI.
</center>
<p>
    [The <i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i> gives the following sketch as a
    "<i>pendant</i> to Mr. Pouqueville's picture of the poet, given in a
    preceding page," and requoted by us in the last No. of the MIRROR. It is
    from a History of Greece, by Rizo, a Wallachian sentimentalist of the
    first order, and in enthusiasm and exuberance of style, it will perhaps
    compare with any previous sketches of the late Lord Byron: but the
    romantic interest which Rizo has thrown about these "more last words"
    will doubtless render them acceptable to our readers.]
</p>
<p>
    For several years a man, a poet, excited the admiration of civilized
    people. His sublime genius towered above the atmosphere, and penetrated,
    with a searching look, even into the deepest abysses of the human heart.
    Envy, which could not reach the poet, attacked the man, and wounded him
    cruelly; but, too great to defend, and too generous to revenge himself,
    he only sought for elevated impressions, and "<i>vivoit de grand
    sensations</i>," (which we cannot translate), capable of the most noble
    devotedness, and, persuaded that excellence is comprised in justice, he
    embraced the cause of the Greeks. Still young, Byron had traversed Greece,
    <i>properly so called</i>, and described the moral picture of its inhabitants.
    He quitted these countries, pitying in his verses the misery of the
    Greeks, blaming their lethargy, and despising their stupid submission; so
    difficult is it to know a nation by a rapid glance. What was the
    astonishment of the poet, when some years later he saw these people, whom
    he had thought unworthy to bear the name of Greeks, rise up with
    simultaneous eagerness, and declare, in the face of the world, that "they
    <i>would</i> again become a nation." Byron hesitated at first; ancient
    prepossessions made him attribute this rupture to a partial convulsion,
    the ultimate effort of a being ready to breathe the last sigh. Soon new
    prodigies, brilliant exploits, and heroic constancy, which sustained
    itself in spite of every opposition, proved to him that he had ill-judged
    this people, and excited him to repair his error by the sacrifice of his
    fortune and life; he wished to concur in the work of regeneration. From
    the shores of the beautiful Etruria he set sail for Greece, in the month
    of August, 1823. He visited at first the seven Ionian Isles, where he
    sojourned some time, busied in concluding the first Greek loan. The death
    of Marco Botzaris redoubled the enthusiasm of Byron, and perhaps
    determined him to prefer the town of Missolonghi, which already showed
    for its glory the tombs of Normann, Kyriakoulis, and Botzaris. Alas! that
    town was destined, four months later, to reckon another mausoleum!
</p>
<p>
    Towards the month of November a Hydriote brig of war, commanded by the
    nephew of the brave Criézy, sailed to Cephalonia to take him on board,
    and bring him to Missolonghi; but the Septinsular government, not
    permitting ships bearing a Greek flag to come into its harbours, Byron
    was obliged to pass to Zante in a small vessel, and to join the Greek
    brig afterwards, which was waiting for him near Zante. Hardly was Byron
    on board when he kissed the mainmast, calling it "<i>sacred wood</i>." The
    ship's crew astonished at this whimsical behaviour, regarded him in
    silence; suddenly Byron turned towards the captain and the sailors, whom
    he embraced with tears, and said to them, "It is by this wood that you
    will consolidate your independence." At these words the sailors, moved
    with enthusiasm, regarded him with admiration. Byron soon reached
    Missolonghi: the members of the Administrative Council received him at
    the head of two thousand soldiers drawn up in order. The artillery of the
    place, and the discharge of musquetry announced the happy arrival of this
    great man. All the inhabitants ran to the shore, and welcomed him with
    acclamations. As soon as he had entered the town, he went to the hotel of
    the Administrative Council, where he was complimented by Porphyrios,
    Archbishop of Arta, Lepanto and Etolia, accompanied by all his clergy.
    The first words of Byron were, "Where is the brother of the modern
    Leonidas?" Constantine Botzaris, a young man, tall and well made,
    immediately stepped forward, and Byron thus accosted him:&mdash;"Happy mortal!
    Thou art the brother
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>[pg 246]</span>
 of a hero, whose name will never be effaced in the
    lapse of ages!" Then perceiving a great crowd assembled under the windows
    of the hotel, he advanced towards the casement, and said, "Hellenes! you
    see amongst you an Englishman who has never ceased to study Greece in her
    antiquity, and to think of her in her modern state; an Englishman who has
    always invoked by his vows that liberty, for which you are now making so
    many heroic efforts. I am grateful for the sentiments which you testify
    towards me; in a short time you will see me in the middle of your
    phalanxes, to conquer or perish with you." A month afterwards the
    government sent him a deputation, charged to offer him a sword and the
    patent of Greek citizenship; at the same time the town of Missolonghi
    inscribed him in its archives. For this public act they prepared a solemn
    ceremony for him; they fixed beforehand the day&mdash;they invited there by
    circular letters the inhabitants of the neighbouring districts&mdash;and more
    than twenty thousand persons arrived at Missolonghi. Byron in a Greek
    costume, preceded and followed by all the military, who loved him,
    proceeded to the church, where the Archbishop Porphyrios and the bishop
    of Rogon, Joseph, that martyr of religion and his country, received him
    in the vestibule of the church, clothed in their sacerdotal habits; and,
    after having celebrated mass, they offered him the sword and the patent
    of citizenship. Byron demanded that the sword should be first dedicated
    on the tomb of Marco Botzaris; and immediately the whole retinue, and an
    immense crowd, went out of the church to the tomb of that warrior, which
    had been ornamented with beautiful marble at the expense of the poet.
</p>
<p>
    The archbishop placed the sword upon this tomb, and then Byron, to
    inspire the Greeks with enthusiasm, advanced with a religious silence,
    and stopping all on a sudden, he pronounced this discourse in the Greek
    tongue:&mdash;"What man reposes buried under this stone? What hollow voice
    issues from this tomb? What is this sepulchre, from whence will spring
    the happiness of Greece? But what am I saying? Is it not the tomb of
    Marco Botzaris, who has been dead some months, and who, with a handful of
    brave men, precipitated himself upon the numerous ranks of the most
    formidable enemies of Greece? How dare I approach the sacred place where
    he reposes&mdash;I, who neither possess his heroism nor his virtues? However,
    in touching this tomb, I hope that its emanations will always inflame my
    heart with patriotism." So saying, and advancing towards the sepulchre,
    he kissed it while shedding tears. Every spectator exclaimed, "Lord Byron
    for ever!" "I see," added his lordship, "the sword and the letter of
    citizenship, which the government offers me; from this day I am the
    fellow-citizen of this hero, and of all the brave people who surround me.
    Hellenes! I hope to live with you, to fight the enemy with you, and to
    die with you if it be necessary." Byron, superior to vulgar prejudice,
    saw in the manners of the <i>pallikares</i> an ingenuous simplicity, a manly
    frankness and rustic procedure, but full of honour; he observed in the
    people a docility and constancy capable of the greatest efforts, when it
    shall be conducted by skilful and virtuous men; he observed amongst the
    Greek women natural gaiety, unstudied gentleness, and religious
    resignation to misfortunes.
</p>
<p>
    Byron did not pretend to bend a whole people to his tastes and European
    habits. He came not to censure with a stern look their costumes, their
    dances, and their music; on the contrary, he entered into their national
    dances, he learned their warlike songs, he dressed himself like them, he
    spoke their language; in a word, he soon became a true <i>Roumeliote</i>.
    Consequently, he was adored by all Western Greece; every captain
    acknowledged him with pleasure as his chief; the proud Souliots gloried
    in being under his immediate command. The funds of the first loan being
    addressed to him, and submitted to his inspection, gave him influence,
    not only over continental Greece, but even over the Peloponnesus; so that
    he was in a situation, if not sufficient to stifle discord, at least to
    keep it within bounds. Not having yet fathomed the character of all the
    chief people, as well civil as military, he was sometimes deceived in the
    beginning of his sojourn, which a little hurt his popularity; but being
    completely above trifling passions, being able to strengthen by his union
    with it the party which appeared to him the most patriotic, he might
    without any doubt, with time and experience, have played a part the most
    magnificent and salutary to Greece. At first he had constructed, at his
    own expense, a fort in the little isle of Xéclamisma, the capture of
    which would have given great facilities to the enemies to attack by sea
    Missolonghi or Anatoliko. Missolonghi gave to this important fort the
    name of "Fort Byron." This nobleman conceived afterwards, studied and
    prepared an expedition against the strong place of Lepanto, the capture
    of which would have produced consequences singularly favourable.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>[pg 247]</span>
 Once in
    possession of the means of regularly paying the soldiers, he would have
    been able to form a choice body, and take the town, which did not present
    any difficulty of attack, either on account of the few troops shut up
    there, or the weakness of its fortifications. Byron only waited the
    arrival of the loan, to begin his march.
</p>
<p>
    Thus he led an agreeable life in the midst of a nation which he aimed at
    saving. Enchanted with the bravery of the Souliots, and their manners,
    which recalled to him the simplicity of Homeric times, he assisted at
    their banquets, extended upon the turf; he learnt their pyrrhic dance,
    and he sang in unison the airs of Riga, harmonizing his steps to the
    sound of their national mandolin. Alas! he carried too far his benevolent
    condescension. Towards the beginning of April he went to hunt in the
    marshes of Missolonghi. He entered on foot in the shallows; he came out
    quite wet, and, following the example of the <i>pallikares</i> accustomed to
    the <i>malaria</i>, he would not change his clothes, and persisted in having
    them dried upon his body. Attacked with an inflammation upon the lungs,
    he refused to let himself be bled, notwithstanding the intreaties of his
    physician, of Maurocordato and all his friends. His malady quickly grew
    worse; on the fourth day Byron became delirious; by means of bleeding he
    recovered from his drowsiness, but without being able to speak; then,
    feeling his end approaching, he gave his attendants to understand that he
    wished to take leave of the captains and all the Souliots. As each
    approached, Byron made a sign to them to kiss him. At last he expired in
    the arms of Maurocordato, whilst pronouncing the names of his daughter
    and of Greece. His death was fatal to the nation, which it plunged in
    mourning and tears.

    CEREMONIES RELATING TO THE HAIR.
</center>
<p>
    (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
</p>
<p>
    Among the ancient Greeks, all dead persons were thought to be under the
    jurisdiction of the infernal deities, and therefore no man (says Potter)
    could resign his life, till some of his hairs were cut to consecrate to
    them. During the ceremony of laying out, clothing the dead, and sometimes
    the interment itself, the hair of the deceased person was hung upon the
    door, to signify the family was in mourning. It was sometimes laid upon
    the dead body, sometimes cast into the funeral pile, and sometimes placed
    upon the grave. Electra in Sophocles says, that Agamemnon had commanded
    her and Chrysothemis to pay him this honour:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "With drink-off'rings and <i>locks</i> of <i>hair</i> we must,</p>
<p>  According to his will, his <i>tomb</i> adorn."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
    Candace in Ovid bewails her calamity, in that she was not permitted to
    adorn her lover's tomb with her locks.
</p>
<p>
    At Patroclus's funeral, the Grecians, to show their affection and
    respect to him, covered his body with their hair; Achilles cast it into
    the funeral pile. The custom of nourishing the hair on religious
    accounts seems to have prevailed in most nations. Osiris, the Egyptian,
    consecrated his hair to the gods, as we learn from Diodorus; and in
    Arian's account of India, it appears it was a custom there to preserve
    their hair for some god, which they first learnt (as that author
    reports) from Bacchus.
</p>
<p>
    The Greeks and Romans wore false hair. It was esteemed a peculiar honour
    among the ancient Gauls to have long hair. For this reason Julius Caesar,
    upon subduing the Gauls, made them cut off their hair, as a token of
    submission. In the royal family of France, it was a long time the
    peculiar mark and privilege of kings and princes of the blood to wear
    long hair, artfully dressed and curled; every body else being obliged to
    be polled, or cut round, in sign of inferiority and obedience. In the
    eighth century, it was the custom of people of quality to have their
    children's hair cut the first time by persons they had a particular
    honour and esteem for, who, in virtue of this ceremony, were reputed a
    sort of spiritual parents or godfathers to them. In the year 1096, there
    was a canon, importing, that such as wore long hair should be excluded
    coming into church when living, and not be prayed for when dead.
    Charlemagne wore his hair very short, his son shorter; Charles the <i>Bald</i>
    had none at all. Under Hugh Capet it began to appear again; this the
    ecclesiastics were displeased with, and excommunicated all who let their
    hair grow. Peter Lombard expostulated the matter so warmly with Charles
    the Young, that he cut off his own hair; and his successors, for some
    generations, wore it very short. A professor of Utrecht, in 1650, wrote
    expressly on the question, Whether it be lawful for men to wear long
    hair? and concluded for the negative. Another divine, named Reeves, who
    had written for the affirmative, replied to him. In <i>New</i> England a
    declaration was inscribed in the register of the colony against the
    practice of wearing long hair, which was principally levelled at the
    Quakers, with unjust severity.

    roof, after the Chinese manner, covered with plates of varnished iron of
    different colours, and round each of them is a gallery enclosed with a
    rail. All the angles of the roof are adorned with large dragons, eighty
    in number, covered with a kind of thin glass of various colours, which

<h3>
    MR. HAYDON'S PICTURE OF "CHAIRING THE MEMBERS."
</h3>
<p>
    In our last volume we were induced to appropriate nearly six of our
    columns to a description of Mr. Haydon's Picture of the Mock Election in
    the King's Bench Prison&mdash;or rather <i>the first</i> of a series of pictures to
    illustrate the Election, the subject of the present notice being the
    Second, or the Chairing of the Members, which was intended for the
    concluding scene of the burlesque. It will, therefore, be unnecessary for
    us here to give any additional explanation of the real life of these
    paintings, except so far as may be necessary to the explanation of the
    present picture.
</p>
<p>
    The "<i>Chairing</i>" was acted on a water butt one evening, but was to have
    been again performed in more magnificent costume the next day; just,
    however, as all the actors in this eccentric masquerade, High Sheriff,
    Lord Mayor, Head Constable, Assessor, Poll Clerks, and Members, were
    ready dressed, and preparing to start, the marshal interfered, stopped
    the procession, and, after some parley, was advised to send for the
    guards.
</p>
<p>
    "About the middle of a sunny day," says Mr. Haydon, "when all was quiet,
    save the occasional cracking of a racket ball, while some were reading,
    some smoking, some lounging, some talking, some occupied with their own
    sorrows, and some with the sorrows of their friends, in rushed six fine
    grenadiers with a noble fellow of a sergeant at their head, with bayonets
    fixed, and several rounds of ball in their cartouches, expecting to meet
    (by their looks) with the most desperate resistance."
</p>
<p>
    "The materials thus afforded me by the entrance of the guards, I have
    combined in one moment;" or "I have combined in one moment what happened
    at different moments; the <i>characters</i> and <i>soldiers are all portraits</i>.
    I have only
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>[pg 249]</span>
 used the poets and painters' license, to make out the second
    part of the story, a part that happens in all elections, viz. the
    chairing of the successful candidates."
</p>
<p>
    "In the corner of the picture, on the left of the spectator, are three
    of the guards, drawn up across the door, standing at ease, with all the
    self-command of soldiers in such situations, hardly suppressing a laugh
    at the ridiculous attempts made to oppose them; in front of the guards,
    is the commander of the enemy's forces; viz.&mdash;a little boy with a tin
    sword, on regular guard position, ready to receive and oppose them, with
    a banner of 'Freedom of Election,' hanging on his sabre; behind him
    stands the Lord High Sheriff, affecting to charge the soldiers with his
    mopstick and pottle. He is dressed in a magnificent suit of decayed
    splendour, with an old court sword, loose silk stockings, white shoes,
    and unbuckled knee-bands; his shoulders are adorned with white bows, and
    curtain rings for a chain, hung by a blue ribbon from his neck. Next to
    him, adorned with a blanket, is a character of voluptuous gaiety,
    helmeted by a saucepan, holding up the cover for a shield, and a bottle
    for a weapon. Then comes the Fool, making grimaces with his painted
    cheeks, and bending his fists at the military; while the Lord Mayor with
    his white wand, is placing his hand on his heart with mock gravity and
    wounded indignation at this violation of <i>Magna Charta</i> and civil
    rights. Behind him are different characters, with a porter pot for a
    standard, and a watchman's rattle; while in the extreme distance, behind
    the rattle, and under the wall, is a ragged Orator addressing the
    burgesses on this violation of the privileges of Election.
</p>
<p>
    "Right over the figure with a saucepan, is a Turnkey, holding up a key
    and pulling down the celebrated Meredith; who, quite serious, and
    believing he will really sit in the House, is endeavouring to strike the
    turnkey with a champagne glass. The gallant member is on the shoulders of
    two men, who are peeping out and quizzing.
</p>
<p>
    "Close to Meredith is his fellow Member, dressed in a Spanish hat and
    feather, addressing the Sergeant opposite him, with an arch look, on the
    illegality of his entrance at elections, while a turnkey has taken hold
    of the member's robe, and is pulling him off the water butt with violence.
</p>
<p>
    "The sergeant, a fine soldier, one of the heroes of Waterloo, is smiling
    and amused, while a grenadier, one of the other three under arms, is
    looking at his sergeant for orders.
</p>
<p>
    "In the corner, directly under the sergeant, is a dissipated young man,
    addicted to hunting and sports, without adequate means for the enjoyment,
    attended by his distressed family. He, half intoxicated, has just drawn a
    cork, and is addressing the bottle, his only comfort, while his daughter
    is delicately putting it aside and looking with entreaty at her father.
</p>
<p>
    "The harassed wife is putting back the daughter, unwilling to deprive the
    man she loves, of what, though a baneful consolation, is still one; while
    the little, shoeless boy with his hoop, is regarding his father with that
    strange wonder, with which children look at the unaccountable alteration
    in features and expression, that takes place under the effects of
    intoxication.
</p>
<p>
    "Three pawnbroker's duplicates, one for the child's shoes, 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.,
    one for the wedding ring, 5<i>s</i>., and one for the wife's necklace, 7<i>l</i>.,
    lie at the feet of the father, with the Sporting Magazine; for drunkards
    generally part with the ornaments or even necessaries of their wives and
    children before they trespass on their own.
</p>
<p>
    "At the opposite corner lies curled up the Head Constable, hid away under
    his bed-curtain, which he had for a robe, and slyly looking, as if he
    hoped nobody would betray him. By his side is placed a table, with the
    relics of a luxurious enjoyment, while a washing tub as a wine cooler,
    contains, under the table, Hock, Champagne, Burgundy, and a Pine.
</p>
<p>
    "Directly over the sergeant, on the wall, are written, 'The <i>Majesti</i>
    of the <i>Peepel</i> for ever&mdash;huzza!'&mdash;'No military at Elections!' and 'No
    Marshal!'&mdash;on the standards to the left, are '<i>Confusion to Credit, and
    no fraudulent Creditors</i>.' In the window are a party with a lady smoking
    a hookah; on the ledge of the window, "Success to the detaining Creditor!"
    &mdash;At the opposite window is a portrait of the Painter, looking down on
    the extraordinary scene with great interest&mdash;underneath him is, 'Sperat
    infestis.'
</p>
<p>
    "On a board under the lady smoking, is written the order of the Lord
    Mayor, enjoining <i>Peace</i>, as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    "Banco Regis,<br />
    Court House, July 16,<br />
    In the Sixth year of the<br />
    Reign of GEORGE IV.<br />
</p>
<p>
    "Peremptorily ordered&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    "That the Special Constables and Headboroughs
    of this ancient Bailwick do take into
    custody all Persons found in any way committing
    a breach of the Peace, during the Procession
    of Chairing the Members returned to represent
    this Borough.
</p><p>
  "SIR ROBERT BIRCH, (Collegian) Lord Mayor.
</p>
<p>
    "'A New Way to pay Old Debts,'&mdash;is written over the first turnkey; and
    below it, 'N.B. A very old way, discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>[pg 250]</span>
 3394 years B.C.;' and in the
    extreme distance, over a shop, is&mdash;'Dealer in every thing genuine.'
</p>
<p>
    "While the man beating the long drum, at the opposite end, another the
    cymbals, and the third blowing a trumpet, with the windows all crowded
    with spectators, complete the composition, with the exception of the
    melancholy victim behind the High Sheriff.
</p>
<p>
    "I recommend the contemplation of this miserable creature, once a
    gentleman, to all advocates of imprisonment for debt. First rendered
    reckless by imprisonment&mdash;then hopeless&mdash;then sottish&mdash;and, last of all,
    from utter despair of freedom, insane! Round his withered temples is a
    blue ribbon, with 'Dulce est pro Patriâ mori,' (it is sweet to die for
    one's country); for he is baring his breast to rush on the bayonets of
    the guards, a willing sacrifice, as he believes, poor fellow, for a great
    public principle. In his pocket he has three pamphlets, 'On Water
    Drinking, or The Blessings of Imprisonment for Debt,'&mdash;and Adam Smith's
    'Moral Essays.'&mdash;Ruffles hang from his wrists, the relics of former days,
    rags cover his feeble legs, one foot is naked, and his appearance is that
    of a decaying being, mind and body."
</p>
<p>
    Such is Mr. Haydon's "Explanation" of his own Picture; and it only
    remains for us to give the reader some idea of its most prominent
    beauties. As a whole, it is very superior to the "Election," highly as we
    were disposed to rate the merits of that performance. The style is
    masterly throughout, and every shade of the colouring has all the depth
    and richness which characterize works of real genius. There is a spirit
    in every touch which differs as much from the softened and soulless
    compositions of certain modern artists, as does the florid architecture
    of the ancients from the starved proportions of these days, or the rich
    and graceful style of the Essayists from the fabrications of little,
    self-conceited biographers. In short, the whole scene is dashed off in the
    first style of art; the subject and humour are all over English&mdash;true to
    nature, and so forcible as to seize on the attention of the most listless
    beholder.
</p>
<p>
    We must notice a few of the details. The three guards are foremost in the
    picture, and in merit; the struggle in their countenances between
    discipline and a sense of the ludicrous scene before them is admirably
    represented; as well as the little urchin with his tin sword. The centre
    figure of the High Sheriff, with his tattered and faded finery of office,
    is equally clever; but the skill with which the artist has contrived to
    express his forced mirth, and mopstick bravado, is still more forcible.
    The troubled countenance of the Lord Mayor is an excellent portrait of
    the indignation of little authority when perturbed by men of greater
    place. The faces of the turnkey and the sergeant are likewise admirable;
    and that of the soldier looking towards the latter for orders, is like an
    excellent piece of byplay in the farce. The drunken patriot, behind the
    High Sheriff, is well entitled to the attention which the artist, in his
    explanation, suggests; but the spectator must not dwell too long on this
    sorrowful wreck of fallen nature. The group in the foreground of the
    right hand corner, is an episode which must not be omitted, for it
    corresponds with the fine portrait in the same situation in the "Election"
    picture. The reckless dissipation of the fine, young fox-hunter, the half
    intoxicated chuckle with which he holds the bottle, the grief of his
    daughter and wife, and the little shoeless boy with his hoop, are finely
    contrasted with the rich humour and extravagant burlesque of all around
    them. The slyness of the Head Constable, in the left hand corner, half
    smothered in his mock robes, is expressively told; and the painter is a
    capital likeness.
</p>
<p>
    From the success of Mr. Haydon in the particular line of art requisite
    for scenes of real humour, it is not unlikely that his execution of the
    first picture, the "Election" may prove one of the most fortunate events
    in his professional career, and turn out to be one of the "sweet uses of
    adversity," by eliciting talent which he probably did not believe himself
    to possess. Much as we admire this style of art, we can but deplore that
    purchasers cannot be found for such pictures as his <i>Entry into
    Jerusalem</i>, and <i>Judgment of Solomon</i>, both which, with two others, are
    exhibited in the room with the Chairing of the Members. Out of the scores
    of new churches which are yearly completed, surely some altar-pieces
    might be introduced with propriety; and when we consider the peculiar
    influence which such scenes as those chosen by Mr. Haydon are known to
    possess over the human heart, we do not think their entire exclusion from
    modern churches contributes to their devotional character.
</p>
<p>
    Such pictures are intended for better purposes than mere seclusion in
    large galleries and mansions, of which there are but comparatively few in
    England; and it is always with regret that we see these noble efforts of
    art in such profitless situations. Occasionally a nobleman, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>[pg 251]</span>
 parochial
    taste, introduces a valuable painted window, and sometimes an altarpiece
    into a church; but we wish the practice were more general.

<h3>
    ENGLAND IN THE DAYS OF GOOD "QUEEN BESS."
</h3>
<p>
    The misery and mendicity which prevailed in this country before the
    provisions of the poor laws in the time of Elizabeth became duly enforced,
    might be proved by the following extract from a curious old pamphlet,
    which describes, in very forcible language, the poverty and idleness
    which prevailed in one of the fairest and most fertile districts of the
    kingdom, viz.&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    The Golden Vale in Herefordshire, (being ye pride of al that country,)
    being the richest yet (for want of employment) the plentifullest place of
    poore in the kingdom&mdash;yielding two or three hundred folde; the number so
    increasing (idleness having gotten the upper hand;) if trades bee not
    raised&mdash;beggery will carry such reputation in my quarter of the country,
    as if it had the whole to halves.
</p>
<p>
    There bee, says this author, within a mile and a halfe from my house
    every waye, five hundred poore habitations; whose greatest meanes consist
    in spinning flaxe, hemp, and hurdes. They dispose the seasons of the
    yeare in this manner; I will begin with May, June, and July, (three of
    the merriest months for beggers,) which yield the best increase for their
    purpose, to raise multitudes: whey, curdes, butter-milk, and such belly
    provision, abounding in the neighbourhood, serves their turne. As wountes
    or moles hunt after wormes, the ground being dewable, so these idelers
    live intolerablie by other meanes, and neglect their painfull labours by
    oppressing the neighbourhood. August, September, and October, with that
    permission which the Lord hath allowed the poorer sorte to gather the
    eares of corne, they do much harme. I have seen three hundred leazers or
    gleaners in one gentleman's corn-field at once; his servants gathering
    and stouking the bound sheaves, the sheaves lying on the ground like dead
    carcases in an overthrown battell, they following the spoyle, not like
    souldiers (which scorne to rifle) but like theeves desirous to steale; so
    this army holdes pillaging, wheate, rye, barly, pease, and oates; oates,
    a graine which never grew in Canaan, nor AEgypt, and altogether out of
    the allowance of leazing.
</p>
<p>
    Under colour of the last graine, oates, it being the latest harvest,
    they doe (without mercy in hotte bloud) steale, robbe orchards, gardens,
    hop-yards, and crab trees; so what with leazing and stealing, they doe
    poorly maintaine themselves November, December, and almost all January,
    with some healpes from the neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>
    The last three moneths, February, March, and Aprill, little labour serves
    their turne, they hope by the heat of the sunne, (seasoning themselves,
    like snakes, under headges,) to recover the month of May with much
    poverty, long fasting, and little praying; and so make an end of their
    yeares travel in the Easter holy days.

<h3>
    BEGGARS.
</h3>
<p>
    In the earlier periods of their history, both in England and Scotland,
    beggars were generally of such a description as to entitle them to the
    epithet of <i>sturdy</i>; accordingly they appear to have been regarded often
    as impostors and always as nuisances and pests. "Sornares," so violently
    denounced in those acts, were what are here called "masterful beggars,"
    who, when they could not obtain what they asked for by fair means, seldom
    hesitated to take it by violence. The term is said to be Gaelic, and to
    import a soldier. The life of such a beggar is well described in the
    "Belman of London," printed in 1608&mdash;"The life of a beggar is the life of
    a souldier. He suffers hunger and cold in winter, and heate and thirste
    in summer; he goes lowsie, he goes lame; he is not regarded; he is not
    rewarded; here only shines his glorie. The whole kingdome is but his walk;
    a whole cittie is but his parish. In every man's kitchen is his meate
    dressed; in every man's sellar lyes his beere; and the best men's purses
    keepe a penny for him to spend."
</p>
<hr />
<h3>
    CURIOUS MANORIAL CUSTOM.
</h3>
<p>
    At King's Hill, about half a mile north-east of Rocford Church, Essex, is
    held what is called the <i>Lawless Court</i>, a whimsical custom, the origin
    of which is not known. On the Wednesday morning next after Michaelmas day,
    the tenants are bound to attend upon the first cock-crowing, and to kneel
    and do their homage, without any kind of light, but such as heaven will
    afford. The steward of the court calls all such as are bound to appear,
    with as low a voice as possible, giving no notice when he goes to execute
    his office; however, he that does not give an answer is deeply amerced.
    They are all to whisper to each other, nor have they any pen and ink, but
    supply that deficiency
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span>
 with a coal; and he that owes suit and service,
    and appears not, forfeits to the lord of the manor double his rent every
    hour he is absent.
</p>
<p>
    A tenant, some years ago, forfeited his land for non attendance, but was
    restored to it, the lord taking only a fine.

    THE PET DOG.
</h3>
<p>
    Dogs, when they are sure of having their own way, have sometimes ways as
    odd as those of the unfurred, unfeathered animals, who walk on two legs,
    and talk, and are called rational. My beautiful, white greyhound,
    Mayflower, for instance, is as whimsical as the finest lady in the land.
    Amongst her other fancies, she has taken a violent affection for a most
    hideous stray dog, who made his appearance here about six months ago,
    and contrived to pick up a living in the village, one can hardly tell
    how. Now appealing to the charity of old Rachael Strong, the
    laundress&mdash;a dog-lover by profession; now winning a meal from the
    light-footed and open-hearted lasses at the Rose; now standing on his
    hind-legs to extort, by sheer beggary, a scanty morsel from some pair of
    "drowthy cronies," or solitary drover, discussing his dinner or supper
    on the alehouse-bench; now catching a mouthful, flung to him in pure
    contempt by some scornful gentleman of the shoulder-knot, mounted on his
    throne, the coach-box, whose notice he had attracted by dint of
    ugliness; now sharing the commons of Master Keep the shoemaker's pigs;
    now succeeding to the reversion of the well-gnawed bone of Master Brow
    the shopkeeper's fierce house-dog; now filching the skim-milk of Dame
    Wheeler's cat:&mdash;spit at by the cat; worried by the mastiff; chased by
    the pigs; screamed at by the dame; stormed at by the shoemaker; flogged
    by the shopkeeper; teased by all the children, and scouted by all the
    animals of the parish;&mdash;but yet living through his griefs, and bearing
    them patiently, "for sufferance is the badge of all his tribe;"&mdash;and
    even seeming to find, in an occasional full meal, or a gleam of
    sunshine, or a whisp of dry straw, on which to repose his sorry carcass,
    some comfort in his disconsolate condition.
</p>
<p>
    In this plight was he found by May, the most high-blooded and
    aristocratic of greyhounds; and from this plight did May rescue him;&mdash;
    invited him into her territory, the stable; resisted all attempts to
    turn him out; reinstated him there, in spite of maid, and boy, and
    mistress, and master; wore out every body's opposition, by the activity
    of her protection, and the pertinacity of her self-will; made him sharer
    of her bed and her mess; and, finally, established him as one of the
    family as firmly as herself.
</p>
<p>
    Dash&mdash;for he has even won himself a name amongst us, before he was
    anonymous&mdash;Dash is a sort of a kind of a spaniel; at least there is in
    his mongrel composition some sign of that beautiful race. Besides his
    ugliness, which is of the worst sort&mdash;that is to say, the shabbiest&mdash;he
    has a limp on one leg that gives a peculiarly one-sided awkwardness to
    his gait; but, independently of his great merit in being May's pet, he
    has other merits which serve to account for that phenomenon&mdash;being,
    beyond all comparison the most faithful, attached, and affectionate
    animal that I have ever known; and that is saying much. He seems to think
    it necessary to atone for his ugliness by extra good conduct, and does so
    dance on his lame leg, and so wag his scrubby tail, that it does any one,
    who has a taste for happiness, good to look at him&mdash;so that he may now be
    said to stand on his own footing. We are all rather ashamed of him when
    strangers come in the way, and think it necessary to explain that he is
    May's pet; but amongst ourselves, and those who are used to his
    appearance, he has reached the point of favouritism in his own person. I
    have, in common with wiser women, the feminine weakness of loving
    whatever loves me&mdash;and, therefore, like Dash. His master has found out
    that Dash is a capital finder, and, in spite of his lameness, will hunt a
    field, or beat a cover with any spaniel in England&mdash;and, therefore, <i>he</i>
    likes Dash. The boy has fought a battle, in defence of his beauty, with
    another boy, bigger than himself, and beat his opponent most handsomely&mdash;
    and, therefore, <i>he</i> likes Dash; and the maids like him, or pretend to
    like him, because we do&mdash;as is the fashion of that pliant and imitative
    class. And now Dash and May follow us every where, and are going with us
    now to the Shaw, or rather to the cottage by the Shaw, to bespeak milk
    and butter of our little dairy-woman, Hannah Bint&mdash;a housewifely
    occupation, to which we owe some of our pleasantest rambles&mdash;<i>Miss
    Mitford</i>.&mdash;<i>Month. Mag</i>.

<h3>
    EELS.
</h3>
<p>
    The problem of the generation of eels is one of the most abstruse and
    curious in natural history; but we have been much pleased, and not a
    little enlightened, by some observations on the subject in Sir Humphrey
    Davy's delightful little volume, <i>Salmonia</i>, of which the following is
    the substance:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Although the generation of eels occupied the attention of Aristotle, and
    has been taken up by the most distinguished naturalists since his time,
    it is still unsolved. Lacepède, the French naturalist, asserts, in the
    most unqualified way, that they are <i>viviparous</i>; but we do not remember
    any facts brought forward on the subject. Sir Humphrey then goes on to
    say&mdash;This is certain, that there are two migrations of eels&mdash;one up and
    one down rivers, one <i>from</i> and the other <i>to</i> the sea; the first in
    spring and summer, the second in autumn or early winter. The first of
    very small eels, which are sometimes not more than two or two and a half
    inches long; the second of large eels, which sometimes are three or four
    feet long, and which weigh from 10 to 15, or even 20 lbs. There is great
    reason to believe that all eels found in fresh water are the results of
    the first migration; they appear in millions in April and May, and
    sometimes continue to rise as late even as July and the beginning of
    August. I remember this was the case in Ireland in 1823. It had been a
    cold, backward summer; and when I was at Ballyshannon, about the end of
    July, the mouth of the river, which had been in flood all this month,
    under the fall, was blackened by millions of little eels, about as long
    as the finger, which were constantly urging their way up the moist rocks
    by the side of the fall. Thousands died, but their bodies remaining moist,
    served as the ladder for others to make their way; and I saw some
    ascending even perpendicular stones, making their road through wet moss,
    or adhering to some eels that had died in the attempt. Such is the energy
    of these little animals, that they continue to find their way, in immense
    numbers, to Loch Erne. The same thing happens at the fall of the Bann,
    and Loch Neagh is thus peopled by them; even the mighty Fall of
    Shaffausen does not prevent them from making their way to the Lake of
    Constance, where I have seen many very large eels. There are eels in the
    Lake of Neufchatel, which communicates by a stream with the Rhine; but
    there are none in the Lake of Geneva, because the Rhone makes a
    subterraneous fall below Geneva; and though small eels can pass by moss
    or mount rocks, they cannot penetrate limestone rocks, or move against a
    rapid descending current of water, passing, as it were, through a pipe.
    Again: no eels mount the Danube from the Black Sea; and there are none
    found in the great extent of lakes, swamps, and rivers communicating with
    the Danube&mdash;though some of these lakes and morasses are wonderfully
    fitted for them, and though they are found abundantly in the same
    countries, in lakes and rivers connected with the ocean and the
    Mediterranean. Yet, when brought into confined water in the Danube, they
    fatten and thrive there. As to the instinct which leads young eels to
    seek fresh water, it is difficult to reason; probably they prefer warmth,
    and, swimming at the surface in the early summer, find the lighter water
    warmer, and likewise containing more insects, and so pursue the courses
    of fresh water, as the waters from the land, at this season, become
    warmer than those from the sea. Mr. J. Couch, in the Linnaean
    Transactions, says the little eels, according to his observation, are
    produced within reach of the tide, and climb round falls to reach fresh
    water from the sea. I have sometimes seen them in spring, swimming in
    immense shoals in the Atlantic, in Mount Bay, making their way to the
    mouths of small brooks and rivers. When the cold water from the autumnal
    flood begins to swell the rivers, this fish tries to return to the sea;
    but numbers of the smaller ones hide themselves during the winter in the
    mud, and many of them form, as it were, masses together. Various authors
    have recorded the migration of eels in a singular way; such as Dr. Plot,
    who, in his History of Staffordshire, says they pass in the night across
    meadows from one pond to another; and Mr. Arderon, in the Philosophical
    Transactions, gives a distinct account of small eels rising up the
    flood-gates and posts of the water-works of the city of Norwich; and
    they made their way to the water above, though the boards were smooth
    planed, and five or six feet perpendicular. He says, when they first
    rose out of the water upon the dry board, they rested a little&mdash;which
    seemed to be till their slime was thrown out, and sufficiently
    glutinous&mdash;and then they rose up the perpendicular
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>[pg 254]</span>
 ascent with the same
    facility as if they had been moving on a plane surface.&mdash;There can, I
    think, be no doubt that they are assisted by their small scales, which,
    placed like those of serpents, must facilitate their progressive motion;
    these scales have been microscopically observed by Lewenhoeck. Eels
    migrate from the salt water of different sizes, but I believe never when
    they are above a foot long&mdash;and the great mass of them are only from two
    and a half to four inches. They feed, grow, and fatten in fresh water.
    In small rivers they seldom become very large; but in large, deep lakes
    they become as thick as a man's arm, or even leg; and all those of a
    considerable size attempt to return to the sea in October or November,
    probably when they experience the cold of the first autumnal rains.
    Those that are not of the largest size, as I said before, pass the
    winter in the deepest parts of the mud of rivers and lakes, and do not
    seem to eat much, and remain, I believe, almost torpid. Their increase
    is not certainly known in any given time, but must depend upon the
    quantity of their food; but it is probable they do not become of the
    largest size from the smallest in one or even two seasons; but this, as
    well as many other particulars, can only be ascertained by new
    observations and experiments. Block states, that they grow slowly, and
    mentions that some had been kept in the same pond for fifteen years. As
    very large eels, after having migrated, never return to the river again,
    they must (for it cannot be supposed that they all die immediately in
    the sea) remain in salt water; and there is great probability that they
    are then confounded with the conger, which is found from a few ounces to
    one hundred pounds in weight.

<p>
    One great protection against all creeping things is, to stir the ground
    very frequently along the foot of the wall. That is their great place of
    resort; and frequent stirring and making the ground very fine, disturbs
    the peace of their numerous families, gives them trouble, makes them
    uneasy, and finally harasses them to death.

<h3>
    SIR W. TEMPLE'S GARDEN.
</h3>
<p>
    It was formerly the fashion to have a sort of canal, with broad grass
    walks on the sides, and with the water coming up to within a few inches
    of the closely shaven grass; and certainly few things were more beautiful
    than these. Sir William Temple had one of his own constructing in his
    gardens at Moor Park. On the outsides of the grass-walks were borders of
    beautiful flowers. I have stood for hours to look at this canal, which
    the good-natured manners of those days had led the proprietor to make an
    opening in the outer wall in order that his neighbours might enjoy the
    sight as well as himself; I have stood for hours, when a little boy,
    looking at this object; I have travelled far since, and have seen a great
    deal; but I have never seen any thing of the gardening kind so beautiful
    in the whole course of my life&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.

<h3>
    BULBOUS ROOTS.
</h3>
<p>
    In glasses filled with water, bulbous roots, such as the hyacinth,
    narcissus, and jonquil, are blown. The time to put them in is from
    September to November, and the earliest ones will begin blowing about
    Christmas. The glasses should be blue, as that colour best suits the
    roots; put water enough in to cover the bulb one-third of the way up,
    less rather than more; let the water be soft, change it once a week, and
    put in a pinch of salt every time you change it. Keep the glasses in a
    place moderately warm, and <i>near to the light</i>. A parlour window is a
    very common place for them, but is often too warm, and brings on the
    plants too early, and causes them to be weakly.&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.

<hr />
<h3>
    TRAVELLING INVALIDS.
</h3>
<p>
    We cannot refrain from stating our belief, and this on the authority of
    intelligent physicians, as well as from personal observation, that much
    mischief is done by committing invalids to long and precarious journeys,
    for the sake of doubtful benefits. We have ourselves seen consumptive
    patients hurried along, through all the discomforts of bad roads, bad
    inns, and indifferent diet, to places, where certain partial advantages
    of climate poorly compensated for the loss of the many benefits which
    home and domestic care can best afford. We have seen such invalids lodged
    in cold, half-furnished houses, and shivering under blasts of wind from
    the Alps or Apennines, who might more happily have been sheltered in the
    vales of Somerset or Devon. On this topic, however, we refrain from
    saying more&mdash;further than to state our belief, that much misapprehension
    generally prevails, as to the comparative healthiness of England, and
    other parts of Europe. Certain phrases respecting climate have obtained
    fashionable currency amongst us, which greatly mislead the judgment as to
    facts. The accurate statistical tables, now extended to the greater part
    of Europe, furnish more secure grounds of opinion; and from these we
    derive the knowledge, that there is no one country in Europe where the
    average proportion of mortality is so small as in England. Some few
    details on this subject we subjoin,&mdash;tempted to do so by the common
    errors prevailing in relation to it.
</p>
<p>
    The proportion of deaths to the population is nearly one-third less in
    England than in France. Comparing the two capitals, the average mortality
    of London is about one-fifth less than that of Paris. What may appear a
    more singular statement, the proportion of deaths in London, a vast and
    luxurious metropolis, differs only by a small fraction from that of the
    whole of France; and is considerably less than the average of those
    Mediterranean shores which are especially frequented by invalids for the
    sake of health. In Italy, the proportion of deaths is a full third
    greater than in England; and even in Switzerland and Sweden, though the
    difference be less, it is still in favour of our own country.&mdash;<i>Q. Rev</i>.
</p>
<hr />
<h3>
    NEWSPAPER LOVE.
</h3>
<p>
    The paper so highly esteemed, entitled, <i>The Courier de l'Europe</i>,
    originated in the following circumstances:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    "Monsieur Guerrier de Berance was a native of Auvergne, whose fortune in
    the origin was very low, but who by his intrigues succeeded in gaining
    the place of Procureur General of the Custom-house. He married two wives;
    the name of the last was Millochin, who was both young
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>[pg 256]</span>
 and handsome. She
    soon began to find out that her husband was very disagreeable; and what
    caused her more particularly to remark his faults was her contrasting him
    with M. Cevres de la Tour, with whom she fell most desperately in love.
    This passion became so violent, that Madame Guerrier fled into England
    with her lover, who, in his turn, left his wife behind him in Paris. The
    finances of these two lovers growing rather low, M. Sevres de la Tour,
    who was a man of talent, thought, as a plan to enrich himself, to turn
    editor to a newspaper, and for this purpose started the <i>Courier de
    l'Europe</i>, which succeeded beyond his most sanguine hopes. Disgust, which
    commonly follows these sort of unions, caused Madame Guerrier to be
    deserted by her lover, and she was obliged to turn a teacher of languages
    for her subsistence.&mdash;<i>The Album of Love</i>.

    THE BITER BIT.
</h3>
<p>
    In the reign of Charles II. a physician to the court was walking with the
    king in the gallery of Windsor Castle, when they saw a man repairing a
    clock fixed there. The physician knowing the king's relish for a joke,
    accosted the man with, "My good friend, you are continually doctoring
    that clock, and yet it never goes well. Now if I were to treat my
    patients in such a way, I should lose all my credit. What can the reason
    be that you mistake so egregiously?" The man dryly replied, "The reason
    why you and I, Sir, are not upon a par is plain enough&mdash;the sun discovers
    all my blunders, but the earth covers yours."

<p> Mrs. A.T. Thomson, in her <i>Memoirs of the Court of Henry the
Eighth</i>, says, "On the night of the Epiphany (1510), a pageant was
introduced into the hall at Richmond, representing a hill studded with
gold and precious stones, and having on its summit a tree of gold, from
which hung roses and pomegranates. From the declivity of the hill
descended a lady richly attired, who, with the gentlemen, or, as they
were then called, children of honour, danced a morris before the king.
On another occasion, in the presence of the court, an artificial forest
was drawn in by a lion and an antelope, the hides of which were richly
embroidered with golden ornaments; the animals were harnessed with
chains of gold, and on each sat a fair damsel in gay apparel. In the
midst of the forest, which was thus introduced, appeared a gilded tower,
at the end of which stood a youth, holding in his hands a garland of
roses, as the prize of valour in a tournament which succeeded the
pageant!"</p>

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
